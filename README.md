# CS1632_Exercise6
## Modified Methods:
* printSieve (Changed title to camelCase. Changed it to check that args.length > 0 rather than == 0).
* convertResults (Use Integer.valueOf() rather than making a new Integer)
* calculateMax (throw an exception instead of just declaring its existence)
* main (Update modified printSieve name)
